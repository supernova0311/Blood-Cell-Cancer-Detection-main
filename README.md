Blood Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project develops a CNN-based model to identify blood cells, achieving over 99% accuracy. Using a dataset of 17,092 images of normal blood cells collected from healthy individuals (dataset link), the model leverages convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.

Key Features

Dataset: Images of normal blood cells.
Model: CNNs for accurate classification.
Results: >99% validation accuracy.
Dependencies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.
The model is user-friendlyâ€”input a blood cell image to get a precise prediction.
